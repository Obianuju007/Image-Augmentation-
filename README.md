# Image-Augmentation
-Below is a step by step tutorial on how I achieved image augmentation using keras in my spyder IDE. I wanted to explore my options by also using Tensorflow but for object detection, and I encountered a problem with my pycocotools refusing to install, I didn’t ponder too much into it as I should but I’ll still get back to it someday. Now, back to the situationship we have. 
What is data or image augmentation? it is useful if you would like to increase the amount of training of validation data or augment your data. If you have 2000 images and would like to augment it to get 5000 or 10,000 of those images, data augmentation can be useful but if you only have about 5 or 10 images, don’t expect to get 2000 or 20000 out of data augmentation and still be able to get decent results out of your deeplearning because the deeplearning is going to be bias towards these 5 or 10 images that you are augmenting. If you have less than 100 or 200 images, it is recommended that your use the traditional machine learning method. This is because you can extract features and use random forest or support vector machines.
